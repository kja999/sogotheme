This is a custom css file for use with mailcow.

Should be placed in /opt/mailcow-dockerized/data/conf/sogo (if using the standard /opt/ folder for mailcow docker).
Mailcow also gives instructions to map this via an override yml into the container : https://docs.mailcow.email/manual-guides/SOGo/u_e-sogo/

So far gives a blue theme, but the start of the file defines some variables to use. Only main-bg/light-bg/dark-bg are used so far
